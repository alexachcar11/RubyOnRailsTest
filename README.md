# README

Created a basic application using Ruby on Rails that supported CRUD functionality. 

I created and setup the application following the guidelines from here: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

I used HTML and CSS to make the website more appealing to look at.

In order to run the application, you need to follow the first handful of steps indicated on the link given above.

My application was hosted locally on http://localhost:3000/
